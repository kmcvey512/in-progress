                    <h3>A little bit about me.</h3>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I am located in the Austin, Texas area, and I love being creative! I have a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Human Resources Management. The thing is, that I realized that being in HR was not really my passion when I was in my last two classes. I realized my passion is in computers, being creative, and I started learning how to code. After learning HTML, some HTML5, and CSS I decided that making my own site and getting into the tech industry was a much smarter choice for me. </p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>My creative side became very strong when I learned how to code, and that I could design my own website. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to web developement, where I can use my problem-solving skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code. </p>
